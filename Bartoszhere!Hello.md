# Hello-user-
This is my GitHub where you can see what I'm currently working on. I'm a GCP freak (but still in the process of learning), the same as Python and selected python libraries. 

I'm more into web and mobile app development, and this is the way I would like to develop. 

I love mixing python development with GCP development.
